# Julia introduction

# Best place to introduce yourself to julia is:
# https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html

# Objectives:
# 1. Get familiarised with Atom and Julia
# 2 Learn how arrays work in Julia
# 3. Learn how to make for loops
# 4. Learn how to write functions

## Atom and Julia

# Atom - script editor
# Julia - programming language
# Julia REPL (terminal)
# Packages and Panes in Atom
# Packages in Julia
# Help in Julia

## General Comments
# To run a line/function and stay on the line/function, click on a line and type CTRL + ENTER (for Windows) and COMMAND + ENTER (for Mac)
# To run a line/function and move to the next batch of code, click on the line and type SHIFT + ENTER (for both Windows and Mac)
# Any answer will pop up on your script. You can type code into the REPL below and the answer will return in the REPL.
# Any plots you make will open in the Plots tab.
# You can drag and drop tabs to suit whatever you want


## Arrays in Julia

# An array is a sequence of values (any type of value)
[10, 20, 35, 40] # sequence of integers
["crunchy frog", "ram bladder", "lark vomit"] # sequence of strings
["spam", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]] # sequence of strings, floating-point number, integer, and another array
[]
cheeses = ["Cheddar", "Edam", "Gouda"] # you assign arrays to a name using =
cheeses[2] # you can access elements of the array using the index

cheeses[3] = "Cheeeeese , Gromit!" # you can replace specific parts of an array
cheeses

# You can slice arrays
cheeses[1:2]

# Dot operator
[1, 2, 3] .^ 3 # dot operator applys the operator to each element of the array

## For loops

for i in 1:4
    println("Hello Hello")
end

for i in 1:4
    if i % 2 > 0 #the % operator returns the remainder
        println("odd number")
    else
        println("even number")
    end
end

1 % 2 > 0
2 % 2 > 0

array1 = zeros(5) #creates an array of zeros

for i in 1:length(array1)
    array1[i]=i
end

# Exercise 1
# Create a for loop which takes an array filled with zeros (any length) and fills each element sequentially with the square of i
# Next, change this for loop so it takes an array with zeros and fills each element sequentially where even i numbers are squared and off i numbers are multiplied by three

2 ^ 2 # to square use ^ 2
2 * 3 # to multiply by three use * 3

# Functions
# writing your own functions are incredibly important. Remember that what happens in a functions stays in the function (like las vegas). except if you explicitly tell the function to RETURN something
function print_hello(number)
    for i in 1:number
        println("hello")
    end
    return
end

print_hello(3)

# You can use a function within a function
function square_cube(number)
    if number % 2 > 0
        new = number ^ 3
    else
        new = number ^ 2
    end
    return new
end

square_cube(5)

function inception(len)
    array1 = zeros(len)
    for i in 1:len
        array1[i] = square_cube(i)
    end
    return array1
end

inception(4)

# "Special function" - let block
# within this let block, everything stays within the let block (like a function) unless you explicitly tell it to return something. We will use let blocks for creating figures later
let
    array2 = zeros(5)
    for i in 1:length(array2)
        array2[i]=i
    end
    return array2
end

# Exercise 2
# Write a function that takes any string (e.g "christmas") and then prints this string the number of times you specify. (Both the string and the number are variables in the function)
